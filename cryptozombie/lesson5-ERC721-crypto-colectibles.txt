# Lesson5: ERC721 & Crypto-Collectibles

## Chapter 1: Tokens on Ethereum

Let's talk about tokens.

If you've been in the Ethereum space for any amount of time, you've probably heard people talking about tokens — specifically ERC20 tokens.

A token on Ethereum is basically just a smart contract that follows some common rules — namely it implements a standard set of functions that all other token contracts share, such as transfer(address _to, uint256 _value) and balanceOf(address _owner).

Internally the smart contract usually has a mapping, mapping(address => uint256) balances, that keeps track of how much balance each address has.

So basically a token is just a contract that keeps track of who owns how much of that token, and some functions so those users can transfer their tokens to other addresses.

Why does it matter?
Since all ERC20 tokens share the same set of functions with the same names, they can all be interacted with in the same ways.

This means if you build an application that is capable of interacting with one ERC20 token, it's also capable of interacting with any ERC20 token. That way more tokens can easily be added to your app in the future without needing to be custom coded. You could simply plug in the new token contract address, and boom, your app has another token it can use.

One example of this would be an exchange. When an exchange adds a new ERC20 token, really it just needs to add another smart contract it talks to. Users can tell that contract to send tokens to the exchange's wallet address, and the exchange can tell the contract to send the tokens back out to users when they request a withdraw.

The exchange only needs to implement this transfer logic once, then when it wants to add a new ERC20 token, it's simply a matter of adding the new contract address to its database.

Other token standards
ERC20 tokens are really cool for tokens that act like currencies. But they're not particularly useful for representing zombies in our zombie game.

For one, zombies aren't divisible like currencies — I can send you 0.237 ETH, but transfering you 0.237 of a zombie doesn't really make sense.

Secondly, all zombies are not created equal. Your Level 2 zombie "Steve" is totally not equal to my Level 732 zombie "H4XF13LD MORRIS 💯💯😎💯💯". (Not even close, Steve).

There's another token standard that's a much better fit for crypto-collectibles like CryptoZombies — and they're called ERC721 tokens.

ERC721 tokens are not interchangeable since each one is assumed to be unique, and are not divisible. You can only trade them in whole units, and each one has a unique ID. So these are a perfect fit for making our zombies tradeable.

Note that using a standard like ERC721 has the benefit that we don't have to implement the auction or escrow logic within our contract that determines how players can trade / sell our zombies. If we conform to the spec, someone else could build an exchange platform for crypto-tradable ERC721 assets, and our ERC721 zombies would be usable on that platform. So there are clear benefits to using a token standard instead of rolling your own trading logic.


## Chapter 2: ERC721 Standard, Multiple Inheritance
Let's take a look at the ERC721 standard:

contract ERC721 {
  event Transfer(address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _tokenId);
  event Approval(address indexed _owner, address indexed _approved, uint256 _tokenId);

  function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 _balance);
  function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address _owner);
  function transfer(address _to, uint256 _tokenId) public;
  function approve(address _to, uint256 _tokenId) public;
  function takeOwnership(uint256 _tokenId) public;
}
This is the list of methods we'll need to implement, which we'll be doing over the coming chapters in pieces.

It looks like a lot, but don't get overwhelmed! We're here to walk you through it.

Note: The ERC721 standard is currently a draft, and there is no officially agreed-upon implementation yet. For this tutorial we're using the current version from OpenZeppelin's library, but it is possible it will change in the future before its official release. So consider this one possible implementation, but don't take it as the official standard for ERC721 tokens.

Implementing a token contract
When implementing a token contract, the first thing we do is copy the interface to its own Solidity file and import it, import "./erc721.sol";. Then we have our contract inherit from it, and we override each method with a function definition.

But wait — ZombieOwnership is already inheriting from ZombieAttack — how can it also inherit from ERC721?

Luckily in Solidity, your contract can inherit from multiple contracts as follows:

contract SatoshiNakamoto is NickSzabo, HalFinney {
  // Omg, the secrets of the universe revealed!
}
As you can see, when using multiple inheritance, you just separate the multiple contracts you're inheriting from with a comma, ,. In this case, our contract is inheriting from NickSzabo and HalFinney.

Let's give it a try.


## Chapter 3: balanceOf & ownerOf
Great, let's dive into the ERC721 implementation!

We've gone ahead and copied the empty shell of all the functions you'll be implementing in this lesson.

In this chapter, we're going to implement the first two methods: balanceOf and ownerOf.

balanceOf
  function balanceOf(address _owner) public view returns (uint256 _balance);
This function simply takes an address, and returns how many tokens that address owns.

In our case, our "tokens" are Zombies. Do you remember where in our DApp we stored how many zombies an owner has?

ownerOf
  function ownerOf(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address _owner);
This function takes a token ID (in our case, a Zombie ID), and returns the address of the person who owns it.

Again, this is very straightforward for us to implement, since we already have a mapping in our DApp that stores this information. We can implement this function in one line, just a return statement.

Note: Remember, uint256 is equivalent to uint. We've been using uint in our code up until now, but we're using uint256 here because we copy/pasted from the spec.


## Chapter 4: Refactoring

Uh oh! We've just introduced an error in our code that will make it not compile. Did you notice it?

In the previous chapter we defined a function called ownerOf. But if you recall from Lesson 4, we also created a modifier with the same name, ownerOf, in zombiefeeding.sol.

If you tried compiling this code, the compiler would give you an error saying you can't have a modifier and a function with the same name.

So should we just change the function name in ZombieOwnership to something else?

No, we can't do that!!! Remember, we're using the ERC721 token standard, which means other contracts will expect our contract to have functions with these exact names defined. That's what makes these standards useful — if another contract knows our contract is ERC721-compliant, it can simply talk to us without needing to know anything about our internal implementation decisions.

So that means we'll have to refactor our code from Lesson 4 to change the name of the modifier to something else.


## Chapter 5: ERC721: Transfer Logic

Great, we've fixed the conflict!

Now we're going to continue our ERC721 implementation by looking at transfering ownership from one person to another.

Note that the ERC721 spec has 2 different ways to transfer tokens:

function transfer(address _to, uint256 _tokenId) public;
function approve(address _to, uint256 _tokenId) public;
function takeOwnership(uint256 _tokenId) public;
The first way is the token's owner calls transfer with the address he wants to transfer to, and the _tokenId of the token he wants to transfer.

The second way is the token's owner first calls approve, and sends it the same info as above. The contract then stores who is approved to take a token, usually in a mapping (uint256 => address). Then when someone calls takeOwnership, the contract checks if that msg.sender is approved by the owner to take the token, and if so it transfers the token to him.

If you'll notice, both transfer and takeOwnership will contain the same transfer logic, just in reverse order. (In one case the sender of the token calls the function; in the other the receiver of the token calls it).

So it makes sense for us to abstract this logic into its own private function, _transfer, which is then called by both functions. That way we don't repeat the same code twice.


## Chapter 6: ERC721: Transfer Cont'd

## Chapter 7: ERC721: Approve

Now, let's implement approve.

Remember, with approve / takeOwnership, the transfer happens in 2 steps:

You, the owner, call approve and give it the address of the new owner, and the _tokenId you want him to take

The new owner calls takeOwnership with the _tokenId, the contract checks to make sure he's already been approved, and then transfers him the token.

Because this happens in 2 function calls, we need a data structure to store who's been approved for what in between function calls.

Great! That was the difficult part — now implementing the public transfer function will be easy, since our _transfer function already does almost all the heavy lifting.


## Chapter 8: ERC721: takeOwnership

Great, now let's finish up our ERC721 implementation with the last function! (Don't worry, there's still more to cover in Lesson 5 after this 😉)

The final function, takeOwnership, should simply check to make sure the msg.sender has been approved to take this token / zombie, and call _transfer if so.



## Chapter 9: Preventing Overflows

Congratulations, that completes our ERC721 implementation!

That wasn't so tough, was it? A lot of this Ethereum stuff sounds really complicated when you hear people talking about it, so the best way to understand it is to actually go through an implementation of it yourself.

Keep in mind that this is only a minimal implementation. There are extra features we may want to add to our implementation, such as some extra checks to make sure users don't accidentally transfer their zombies to address 0 (which is called "burning" a token — basically it's sent to an address that no one has the private key of, essentially making it unrecoverable). Or to put some basic auction logic in the DApp itself. (Can you think of some ways we could implement that?)

But we wanted to keep this lesson manageable, so we went with the most basic implementation. If you want to see an example of a more in-depth implementation, you can take a look at the OpenZeppelin ERC721 contract after this tutorial.

Contract security enhancements: Overflows and Underflows
We're going to look at one major security feature you should be aware of when writing smart contracts: Preventing overflows and underflows.

What's an overflow?

Let's say we have a uint8, which can only have 8 bits. That means the largest number we can store is binary 11111111 (or in decimal, 2^8 - 1 = 255).

Take a look at the following code. What is number equal to at the end?

uint8 number = 255;
number++;
In this case, we've caused it to overflow — so number is counterintuitively now equal to 0 even though we increased it. (If you add 1 to binary 11111111, it resets back to 00000000, like a clock going from 23:59 to 00:00).

An underflow is similar, where if you subtract 1 from a uint8 that equals 0, it will now equal 255 (because uints are unsigned, and cannot be negative).

While we're not using uint8 here, and it seems unlikely that a uint256 will overflow when incrementing by 1 each time (2^256 is a really big number), it's still good to put protections in our contract so that our DApp never has unexpected behavior in the future.

Using SafeMath
To prevent this, OpenZeppelin has created a library called SafeMath that prevents these issues by default.

But before we get into that... What's a library?

A library is a special type of contract in Solidity. One of the things it is useful for is to attach functions to native data types.

For example, with the SafeMath library, we'll use the syntax using SafeMath for uint256. The SafeMath library has 4 functions — add, sub, mul, and div. And now we can access these functions from uint256 as follows:

using SafeMath for uint256;

uint256 a = 5;
uint256 b = a.add(3); // 5 + 3 = 8
uint256 c = a.mul(2); // 5 * 2 = 10
We'll look at what these functions do in the next chapter, but for now let's add the SafeMath library to our contract.



Chapter 10: SafeMath Part 2
Let's take a look at the code behind SafeMath:

library SafeMath {

  function mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (a == 0) {
      return 0;
    }
    uint256 c = a * b;
    assert(c / a == b);
    return c;
  }

  function div(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    // assert(b > 0); // Solidity automatically throws when dividing by 0
    uint256 c = a / b;
    // assert(a == b * c + a % b); // There is no case in which this doesn't hold
    return c;
  }

  function sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    assert(b <= a);
    return a - b;
  }

  function add(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256 c = a + b;
    assert(c >= a);
    return c;
  }
}
